        <h1 class="blog-post-title">How I learned Ukrainian</h1>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"></p>
        In the spring of 2016, I moved to Ukraine with the intention of learning the Russian language.  For those who aren’t aware, Russian is about as commonly spoken as Ukrainian in most Ukrainian cities, and the vast majority of Ukrainians are fluent in both languages.  Why Ukraine instead of Russia?  Mostly because Ukraine was easier to up and go to (no visa required), but I’d also made a Ukrainian friend at an academic conference the year before who encouraged me to visit and who told me he could help me find a place to stay in Kiev if I wanted to stay there long term.
I spent my first week in Ukraine in Kiev, a huge Soviet city that I never quite felt comfortable in, and then decided to make a trip to the city of Lviv in the far west of the country.  Lviv is fairly close to the Polish border and is the cultural capital of western Ukraine and ipso facto of the Ukrainian language.  With its Austro-Hungarian architecture and its wealth of cafes and restaurants, it’s also one of the most picturesque cities in the world.
After spending a few days in the city, I decided that I preferred Lviv to Kiev and this was reason enough for me to start learning Ukrainian.  I came across Solomiya Buk’s Ukrainian language school and hired a private tutor for about nine dollars an hour.  My tutor and I had one-on-one classes for about three hours a day for about a month, and this was enough study time for me to be able to have spontaneous conversations with anyone I came across.
In fact, after only two weeks, I was already going up to strangers and speaking to and having long conversations with them.  Now, two weeks may seem like a very short time to learn a language, but I had the advantage of having studied another Slavic language.  I had actually lived in Prague in the Czech Republic for about two years before coming to Ukraine and spoke Czech at an advanced level.  The Slavic languages and Romance languages diverged from Old Slavonic and from Latin respectively at about the same time, and I would say that Czech and Ukrainian are about as similar as, say, Spanish and French.  The point is, I already had a foundation of knowledge that I could draw on to learn Ukrainian more quickly and wasn’t confused by some of the weirder features of Ukrainian grammar.
One of the most interesting experiences that I have ever had learning a foreign language occurred while I was learning Ukrainian.  When the receptionist at the hostel that I was working at found out that I was learning Ukrainian, she refused to continue speaking to me in English and insisted that we talk to each other exclusively in Ukrainian.  Every evening, when I got back to the hostel we would talk for about an hour or two.  Now, these conversations started during my first week of studying Ukrainian language, and the amazing thing is that although I didn’t every word that she said, I was able to understand the sense of what she was communicating most of the time.  Through body language, facial expression, intonation, and context clues, I just got what it was she was saying.
All this meant that I was practicing Ukrainian by having a conversation with another person and speaking right from the beginning.  This accelerated my learning very quickly and I would say that my nightly conversations with the receptionist were as important in learning Ukrainian as my classes with a private tutor during the day.
I decided to end my private lessons after a month and study the language independently.  I found work as an English teacher and made some friends around the city, most of whom I spoke to exclusively in Ukrainian.  I also started building this website because I was frustrated by the lack of good Ukrainian language resources available online.
By the end of the summer I felt quite comfortable speaking to people in Ukrainian.  My grammar was not great, and I was more hesitant when speaking to strangers than when talking to friends, but I could converse freely on a virtually unlimited number of topics, and I knew that I would always be understood.
