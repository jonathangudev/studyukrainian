        <div class="entry-content">
            <div>I&rsquo;m going to write another post later on about how to learn Ukrainian in Ukraine, but I wanted to share with you guys a way to learn Ukrainian if you&rsquo;re not in the country.</div>
            <h2>Step 1: &nbsp;Find a Resource</h2>
            <div>When I first started learning Ukrainian a couple of years ago, there were not many good online resources for learning Ukrainian. &nbsp;Obviously, I recommend the Study Ukrainian course here on&nbsp;<a href="https://studyukrainian.com/lessons">this website</a>, but there are also some other pretty good courses out there.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>What you want from an online Ukrainian course is for it to give you a continual source of vocabulary and grammar to learn, especially that&rsquo;s suited for your needs.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>Here are some other good websites with fairly complete courses:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>The Peace Corps Ukrainian Language Course at Live Lingua:
                    <div><a href="http://www.livelingua.com/project/peace-corps/Ukrainian">www.livelingua.com/project/peace-corps/Ukrainian</a></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>UkrainianLessons.com, a&nbsp;blog and podcast with Ukrainian lessons:<br /><a href="http://ukrainianlessons.com/">ukrainianlessons.com</a></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Read Ukrainian! &nbsp;A free course for learning to read Ukrainian texts:<br /><a href="http://www.ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read">http://www.ukrainianlanguage.org.uk/read</a></div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div>I also recommend considering getting a book for learning Ukrainian. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>Teach Yourself Ukrainian</strong>&nbsp;book by James Dingley. &nbsp;Find it on Amazon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Ukrainian-Beginner-Intermediate-Course/dp/1444104136/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528287814&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=teach+yourself+ukrainian&amp;dpID=51jSIA5I8UL&amp;preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;dpSrc=srch">here</a>.</div>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            <div>Finally, it would be unfair not to mention that Duolingo has a Ukrainian course on their app, but I have not found it very useful for myself because the vocabulary that you learn on the app is so random and unconnected to everyday situations.</div>
            <h2>Step 2: &nbsp;Find a Skype Tutor</h2>
            <div>Preply is an online platform connecting Skype tutors with students. &nbsp;You can find Ukrainian teachers for very cheap on this website (I pay $4 an hour for lessons with my teacher), and you can use any of the above online courses as a basis for learning with your teacher.</div>
            <h2>Step 3: &nbsp;Keep Practicing</h2>
            <div>Make flashcards, either physically, or with Anki, and use them to review the words that you&rsquo;ve learned. &nbsp;Try to have real conversations with your Skype teacher. &nbsp;This is the best way to improve speaking a language.</div>
            <h2>Step 4: &nbsp;Learn Ukrainian from Media</h2>
            <div>Watch Ukrainian television and Youtube channels to practice your listening comprehension. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s one good place to find Ukrainian television to watch:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Ukrainian and Russian Language Television Channel:<br /><a href="http://1plus1.ua/">1plus1.ua</a></li>
            </ul>
            <div>Learning a new language can be very challenging, especially if you don&rsquo;t live in the target country, but with the internet there&rsquo;s lots of opportunities to learn the language. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re continually building to improve the lessons on Study Ukrainian, so keep checking back for updates!</div>
